You should call `coding_agent` for any source code update tasks.
You should call `writing_agent` for any writing tasks.

Here is an example of how to use the tools and run shell commands:

```tool
[
    {
        "tool": "tools_without_args",
    },
    {
        "tool": "tools_with_args",
        "args": [
            "arg1": "value1",
            "arg2": "value2"
        ]
    },
    {
        "shell": [
            "shell command",
        ]
    }
]
```
